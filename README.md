It’s so easy for us, as human beings, to just have a glance at a picture and describe it in an appropriate language. But the question arises,can we write a computer program that takes an image as input and produces a relevant caption as output?
The answer is yes, using Deep Learning this problem can be used to solve of generating a caption for a given image, hence the name Image Captioning.
This project has various applications like-
1. Self driving cars — Automatic driving is one of the biggest challenges and if we can properly caption the scene around the car, it can give a boost to the self driving system.
2. Aid to the blind — We can create a product for the blind which will guide them travelling on the roads without the support of anyone else. We can do this by first converting the scene into text and then the text to voice. Both are now famous applications of Deep Learning.
3. CCTV cameras are everywhere today, but along with viewing the world, if we can also generate relevant captions, then we can raise alarms as soon as there is some malicious activity going on somewhere. This could probably help reduce some crime and/or accidents.
